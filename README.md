## Objective Overview
This program is designed with the primary objective of efficiently processing laboratory data stored in CSV format. The program implements algorithms to parse, analyze, and generate reports based on a predefined set of parameters. It is optimized for use in environments requiring accurate and systematic handling of laboratory data.

## Essential Components and Prerequisites
Rust Programming Environment: Ensure the availability of the Rust programming environment for compilation and execution.
CSV Crate Dependency: Integration of the csv crate is imperative for the program's functionality to interpret and process CSV files.
## Operational Procedure
Compilation: Utilize the cargo build command to compile the source code into an executable format.
Execution: On execution, the program will solicit inputs, specifically the file path of the CSV file and the type of assay for processing.
Input File Format: The CSV file should adhere to a structured format encompassing necessary fields such as site, device type, device ID, test type, cycle, datetime, value, and units.
## Core Functionalities
Enumerations (DeviceType, Assay): Defined to categorize and manage various device types and assays systematically.
Data Structures (Submission, FillTemplate, FillTemplate): Utilized for organizing and storing data efficiently.
Methods Implementation: Ensures functional encapsulation and efficient execution of tasks like template filling and data initialization.
Analytical Functions: Algorithms developed to perform analytical tasks such as data aggregation and calculation.
Report Generation Mechanism: Automated process for generating reports based on analyzed data.
## Advantages of Implementation
Data Processing: Capable of transforming raw CSV data into structured, analyzable formats.
Automated Report Generation: Streamlines the process of report creation, enhancing productivity.
Template Customization: Provides flexibility in report formatting and structure.
Multiple Assay and Device Compatibility: Versatile in handling various laboratory tests and equipment.
## Enhancement Protocols
Enum Extension: Introduce new device types and assays by updating the respective enumerations.
Template Modification: Alter LaTeX templates to suit varied report formatting requirements.
CSV Format Adaptation: Modify the record_to_submission function to accommodate changes in CSV data formats.
## Operational Reliability
The program is designed to operate under logical parameters. Inconsistent or malformed data inputs may lead to suboptimal performance. Ensuring data integrity and format consistency is recommended for optimal operation.
